    cert selection: prioritize RSA-PSS certs over RSA
    
    RSA and RSA-PSS can both be used for RSA-PSS operations, and
    as such without prioritizing RSA-PSS certificates it is unknown
    which certificate will be used for an RSA-PSS operation. The
    reason we want to have only RSA-PSS keys used for RSA-PSS operations
    is to cover the use case where a server uses a legacy RSA certificate
    for clients that don't support RSA-PSS and an RSA-PSS certificate
    for the rest, thus separating the keys used for these client
    groups. That separation ensures that any issue on PKCS#1 1.5
    (legacy RSA), would not affect sessions which use RSA-PSS.
    
    Resolves #243

    prior to negotiating a signature check compatibility with private key
    
    That is, check if the private key can support the public key operation
    needed for the signature. That in particular includes, excluding the
    Ed25519 and RSA-PSS from being used with the 'EXT' keys as the
    current API cannot handle them, and RSA-PSS from being used by PKCS#11
    RSA keys which do not provide the CKM_RSA_PKCS_PSS mechanism.

    handshake: select a signature algorithm early
    
    That is, select the signature algorithm at the point the certificate and
    ciphersuites are decided. Also ensure that a compatible signature algorithm
    with the ciphersuite and the key is selected.
    
    That prevents situations where a ciphersuite and a certificate are
    negotiated, but later on the handshake we figure that there are no
    common signature algorithms.

    gnutls_pk_params_st: renamed sign field to spki
    
    The name "sign" was ambiguous with regard to its intented
    use, as it could refer to digital signature parameters
    which was not exactly the case. That field contains parameters
    present in the subject public key info (SPKI), which could
    be used in a digital signature, but not necessarily.

    Clarified the purpose of the spki params related functions
    
    _gnutls_privkey_get_sign_params was renamed to _gnutls_privkey_get_spki_params,
    _gnutls_privkey_update_sign_params to _gnutls_privkey_update_spki_params,
    and the dig entry of gnutls_x509_spki_st was renamed to rsa_pss_dig.
    
    The reason is that there could be a confusion on the purpose of
    the 'dig' entry, as it could be assumed to be the signature's hash
    algorithm in the general case. That could not be because the SPKI
    parameters do not contain it for any other algorithm than RSA-PSS.
    As such, make a logical separation from SPKI reading functions
    with the signature reading functions and try to use the
    gnutls_sign_entry_st when signature information is required.

    server_name: several simplifications of the code base
    
    The existing code was written with the intention of supporting multiple
    server names, however that was never happened, and this extension is
    currently only used for DNS server names. Remove unneeded extensibility.
    
    In addition, removed conversion of client provided server name (DNS) to
    IDNA. Clients not providing valid names are violating the spec and
    that conversion step not only wastes resources, but increases
    the attack surface of a server.

    priorities: share priority structures across sessions
    
    As the contents of the priority cache grows, it makes sense to shared
    these structures across many sessions (in server side) rather than
    copying them to a session. All overrides of the priority contents
    were moved to session->internals. On client side where gnutls_priority_set_direct()
    is more commonly used, ensure that the set priority is deinitialized.
    
    That also introduces gnutls_priority_set2() which does not copy the priority
    contents by default.

    OCSP: check the subject public key identifier field to figure issuer
    
    Normally when attempting to match the 'Responder Key ID' in an OCSP response
    against the issuer certificate we check (according to RFC6960) against the
    hash of the SPKI field. However, in few certificates (see commit:
    "added ECDSA OCSP response verification"), that may not be the case. In that
    certificate, that value matches the Subject Public Key identifier field
    but not the hash.
    
    To account for these certificates, we enhance the matching to also consider
    the Subject Public Key identifier field.

    tests: added unit test for safenet protectserver HSM's PKCS#11 support
    
    That is, detect whether the absence of C_Login will fallback to CKU_USER
    after CKU_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC is tried.

    pkcs11: the GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN will force a login
    
    That is, even in tokens which do not have a CKF_LOGIN_REQUIRED flag
    a login will be forced. This allows operation on the safenet HSMs
    which do not set that flag.

    Handle specially safenet HSMs which cannot handle CKU_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC
    
    These HSMs do not support CKA_ALWAYS_AUTHENTICATE, nor understand CKU_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC,
    but rather return CKR_USER_NOT_LOGGED_IN on the first private key operation.
    Try to discover that state by calling C_Login when CKR_USER_NOT_LOGGED_IN
    is seen, and retrying with CKU_USER after CKU_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC login fails.

     * psktool's -p argument should really be short for --pskfile, not

    x509: implement RSA-PSS signature scheme
    
    This patch enables RSA-PSS signature scheme in the X.509 functions and
    certtool.
    
    When creating RSA-PSS signature, there are 3 different scenarios:
    
    a. both a private key and a certificate are RSA-PSS
    b. the private key is RSA, while the certificate is RSA-PSS
    c. both the private key and the certificate are RSA
    
    For (a) and (b), the RSA-PSS parameters are read from the certificate.
    Any conflicts in parameters between the private key and the certificate
    are reported as an error.
    
    For (c), the sign functions, such as gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign() or
    gnutls_privkey_sign_data(), shall be instructed to generate an RSA-PSS
    signature.  This can be done with the new flag
    GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_RSA_PSS.
    
    Verification is similar to signing, except for the case (c), use the
    flag GNUTLS_VERIFY_USE_RSA_PSS instead of
    GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_RSA_PSS.
    
    From the command line, certtool has a couple of new options: --rsa-pss
    and --rsa-pss-sign.  The --rsa-pss option indicates that the generated
    private key or certificate is restricted to RSA-PSS, while the
    --rsa-pss-sign option indicates that the generated certificate is signed
    with RSA-PSS.
    
    For simplicity, there is no means of choosing arbitrary salt length.
    When it is not given by a private key or a certificate, it is
    automatically calculated from the underlying hash algorithm and the
    RSA modulus bits.

    gnutls_ocsp_status_request_enable_client: removed support for problematic parameters
    
    Removed support for responder_id and extensions parameters. These
    had very difficult semantics to use and the underlying implementation
    had encoding errors, meaning there was no interoperation with other
    clients. Given that issue it means there are no applications depending on
    these parameters; ignore these parameters completely and no longer send
    either responder_id or extensions.

    The reason is that many servers utilize a legacy chain to improve compatibility

    try to construct alternative paths. To maintain compatibility with previous
    versions, we ensure that the same error code (verification status) is returned
    in these cases as before by sending the cached error if the alternative path fails
    too.

    gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2: do not fallback to CN unconditionally
    
    Do not fallback to checking the CN of a certificate for a hostname
    if supported names such as IP addresses were found in gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2().
    This behavioral change is in order to satisfy the RFC6125 requirement
    of not falling back to CN in that case. Reported by Suphannee Sivakorn.

    Introduced verification flag GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_IP_MATCHES
    
    This flag when provided to the gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2() function
    (and its callers), will prevent IP matching of the subject alternative
    name. This can be utilized by applications which directly check for
    IP addresses using gnutls_x509_crt_check_ip().

    Added gnutls_x509_crt_check_ip()
    
    This function allows to directly verify IP addresses on a certificate.
    That is a first step towards making gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2()
    not verify IP addresses.

    Avoid deprecation warnings when including gnutls/abstract.h
    
    Since ac3de8f5, when all openpgp functionality was deprecated, a
    library user including gnutls/abstract.h gets warnings about
    deprecated declarations, like this:
    
    gnutls/openpgp.h:328:10: warning: ‘gnutls_openpgp_recv_key_func’ is deprecated [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
              gnutls_openpgp_recv_key_func func) _GNUTLS_GCC_ATTR_DEPRECATED;
    
    This warning is emitted since the gnutls_openpgp_set_recv_key_function
    prototype uses the deprecated typedef gnutls_openpgp_recv_key_func.
    
    By omitting the deprecation attribute from this individual
    typedef, we avoid the spurious warnings in calling code which just
    includes gnutls/abstract.h without actually using anything related
    to openpgp.

    rnd: reduce calls to _rnd_get_system_entropy
    
    That is, no longer obtain the initial nonces for the RNG
    via _rnd_get_system_entropy() but instead use time-based ones
    which are typically faster kernel calls. This reduces the number
    of expensive system calls done during thread and
    process initialization.

    rnd: switched to 3 chacha-based PRNGs for all security levels
    
    Chacha was selected because it is already present in TLS protocol
    as algorithm, meaning that re-using would improve CPU caching,
    and it is a comparable in performance algorithm to the existing
    PRNG used for nonces (salsa20). The yarrow generator was removed
    because we are primarily seeding from system devices which are
    sufficiently trustworthy to offload us from coping with the
    handling of multiple sources of input. As such it allows
    us to switch to a simpler PRNG such as a stream cipher like Chacha.

    tests: Improve port-checking infrastructure.
    
    The test suite unnecessarily failed on systems without netstat because
    it was assumed to be present.  Instead of simply checking for its
    presence and indicating an unsupported test, however, the ss utility
    can be used as a drop-in replacement.  When netstat/net-tools is not
    present, the ss utility from iproute2 still stands a fair chance of
    existing, and they also have similar enough semantics that they can be
    used interchangeably in the test suite.
    
    The functions in tests/scripts/common.sh that used netstat
    (wait_for_port, wait_for_free_port) now use new functions,
    check_if_port_in_use and check_if_port_listening, to abstract the call
    to netstat/ss.  The eval'd variable GETPORT also used netstat, and has
    been updated accordingly.
    
    The new port-checking functions use another new function,
    have_port_finder, which takes care of the details of selecting ss
    (preferred) or netstat, or fails otherwise.

    gnutls.pc: do not include libidn2 in Requires.private
    
    The libidn2 versions available do not include libidn2.pc,
    thus the inclusion was causing problems when using pkg-config.
    Instead we include -lidn2 in Libs.private.

    openpgp.h: all openpgp functionality was marked as deprecated
    
    This is to prevent new applications using that functionality.
    As the OpenPGP certificate for HTTPS (or TLS in general) never got
    any traction, GnuTLS is the only implementation supporting it,
    and the quality of the OpenPGP supporting code is questionable,
    we deprecate that code with the intention to drop it completely
    when an opportunity is given.

    tests: do not run key-tests under leak sanitizer
    
    The reason is that we cannot distinguish between a memory leak on
    application failure (which is followed by exit- thus should be ignored)
    and an address sanitizer issue (which should never be ignored).
    As such we disable leak detection with asan and rely on valgrind.

    tpm: fix handling of keys requiring authorization
    
    There are several problems with the key handling in the tpm code.
    
    The first, and most serious, is that we should make sure we understand
    the authorization requirements of a key *before* using it.  The reason
    for this is that the TPM has a dictionary attack defence and is
    programmed to lock up after a certain number of authorization failures
    (which can be very small).  If we try first without authorization, we
    may lock up the TPM.  The fix for this is to check whether
    authorization is required and supply it before using the key.
    
    Secondly, if the key does require authorization but no password is
    supplied we should return immediately, since we know the TPM will give
    us an authorization error anyway.
    
    Thirdly, we should unconditionally read the policy of the key rather
    than checking if a policy exists: Policies are tied to key objects, so
    if there is an old policy in s->tpm_key_policy, but we're creating a
    new key, the key it belonged to will be closed, meaning the policy
    will be invalid.  Fix this by always setting the policy each time we
    get a new key object.

    When calling import_tpm_key() once it initializes the key, but
    a second call fails due to the key being already initialized. Ensure
    that failure of import_tpm_key() leaves the key on a clear state.

    configure.ac: detect trousers library on debian

Author: Andreas Metzler <ametzler@bebt.de>
Date:   Sat Dec 3 14:29:51 2016 +0100

    Prevent unwanted linkage to -lhogweed
    
    Specify action-if-found for AC_CHECK_LIB when checking for !SuiteB
    curves to keep autoconf from adding -lhogweed to LIBS. This caused
    linkage of e.g. openssl wrapper and C++ library to -lhogweed. The issue
    only shows up if --disable-libdane is specified, since the dane autoconf
    test resets LIBS.

    For distro reasons, the path on openSUSE is /lib[64]/libtspi.so.1
    which the current code doesn't find.  Fix this by having it search all
    viable system library locations (/lib /lib64 /usr/lib and

    non-fully compliant with RFC4514 string format, while the new

    which relied on the previous format to continue functioning without

    tests: check for gnutls 3.3.x compatibility
    
    That is, check whether the status request extension is not sent
    by the server, if the server does not hold a status response. We
    require that behavior to be backwards compatible with gnutls 3.3.x.

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 26 17:51:11 2016 +0200

    Reverted the behavior of sending a status request extension even without a response
    
    That is, we no longer reply to a client's hello with a status request, with
    a status request extension. Although that behavior which was introduced
    in 6b76e0c899b1ff08df9bd9b41588f771f050be89 is legal, it creates incompatibility
    issues with gnutls 3.3.x branch. That is because versions prior 3.3.26
    translates the presence of the extension as a guarrantee that the status
    response data will be sent. Even though, that is false assumption we
    replicate the previous behavior to allow such clients to connect to
    a gnutls 3.5.x server.

    While the change was fully backwards compatible for applications that were
    adding a single certificate, and applications that were checking for negative
    errors codes, many applications do not. As this may cause incompatibility issues
    with software properly utilizing the previously documented API, the change
    is reverted, and applications need to explicitly enable a flag (GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2)
    in the credentials structure for the set_key functions to return an index.

    gnutls_anon_set_server_known_dh_params(),
    gnutls_psk_set_server_known_dh_params().
    These functions allow to statically set the DH parameters, based
    on the RFC7919 FFDHE parameters. This can simplify server configuration
    by allowing DH without loading parameters from file.

    priorities: Do read crypto policy files with mtime of zero
    
    In a default Fedora Atomic Host installation,
    `/etc/crypto-policies/backends/gnutls.config` is a symlink to the
    default in `/usr/share/`.  On an OSTree-managed system, files in
    `/usr` have an mtime of zero (to help deduplication).
    
    The simple fix here is to still try to read the first time, even if
    the file has an mtime of zero.

    Generating a PKCS #10 certificate request...
    reading --load-privkey: foo

    pkcs11: forbid PKCS#11 extensions to be used in other than trust modules
    
    That is, only use the CKA_X_DISTRUSTED and the extension override in
    p11-kit trust modules, to avoid conflicts with potentially other
    PKCS#11 extensions.

    pkcs11: only staple extensions from a trust module when they are from a non-distrusted certificate
    
    That is, make sure that the API for stapling extensions is only used
    for non-distrusted (blacklisted) certificates. The reason is to avoid
    duplicate extension entries from the p11-kit trust database. These
    come from blacklisted certificates, and we have no reason to support
    stapled extensions with blacklisted certificates.

    This introduces checks for the cases where gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file()

    certificates. The tests then verify whether the expected OCSP response
    is received.

    request handling function per certificate. Furthermore it repurposes
    the flag parameters to an index option on gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file.
    
    The changes above allow setting a different OCSP status response
    file per certificate, and a different function. The indexes they
    rely on to associate with existing certs are the indexes returned
    by the gnutls_certificate_set_key() and friends functions.

    when setting corresponding data (e.g., an OCSP response).

    Import DTLS sliding window validation from OpenConnect ESP code
    
    In this implementation, the end of the sliding window is always advanced
    to the latest received packet, and we accept up to 64 packets before
    that one. We no longer refuse to accept packets because they are
    *too* far ahead of what we've already seen.
    
    Some of the test cases are fixed up accordingly.
    
    This matches the code in OpenConnect esp-seqno.c at commit 314ac65.

    gnutls-cli: fixed the behavior when --starttls or --starttls-proto is given
    
    The change of moving the handshake process as part of the socket establishment
    broke the starttls functionality in gnutls-cli. This change fixes that functionality.
    Reported by Andreas Metzler.

    gnutls-cli: print 'Handshake was completed'
    
    The change of moving the handshake process as part of the socket
    establishment, prevented the text 'Handshake was completed' from
    being printed as part of a successful handshake. That message was
    used by applications like gnus which use gnutls-cli. This patch
    reverts that change and prints that message on successful handshakes.

    tests: Add tests for X509 IP constraints
    
    - Add dedicated test file name-constraints-ip for IP tests.
    - Test the following:
      * Generation and saving of valid name constraints.
      * Trying to save invalid IP constraints.
      * Reading the saved constraints.
      * constraints_check() calls for both IPv4 and IPv6.
      * IP constraints intersection (simple, empty, mediocre, complicated).
      * IPv4/IPv6 constraints interaction and various corner cases.
    - IPs/CIDRs are printed in logs in case of failure.
    - Add 2 new chain tests (positive, negative).
    - Add generated test executable to ignored files.

    x509: Add support for IP constraints
    
    - IP constraints are now checked against the subject alternative
      name field.
    - Implemented IP name constraints merging.
    - Added IP constraints validity checking during loading and getting
      the name constraints object from the user.
    - Add a convenience function name_constraints_node_new that allocates
      a name constraints node and sets its fields. Use this new function
      where applicable.
    - Add documentation for is_nc_empty, _gnutls_name_constraints_node_free,
      _gnutls_name_constraints_intersect.
    - Small improvements elsewhere (polishing).

    - Moved IP/CIDR to string conversion functions into separate
      header and export privately for the use in tests.
    - Placed ip_in_cidr() into separate header for easy testing
    - Add publicly available function to convert text CIDR to RFC5280
      format for the use in name constraints extension.
    - certtool: Use GnuTLS exported CIDR functions instead of local ones.
    - Export mask_to_prefix, mask_ip for internal GnuTLS use.
    - Introduce new error value (malformed cidr) and add to description
      functions in errors.c.

    nettle: use rsa_*_key_prepare on key import
    
    Previously we calculated the size of the key directly, but
    by using the rsa_*_key_prepare we benefit from any checks that
    may be introduced in the future. Specifically any checks for invalid
    public keys (e.g., keys that may crash the underlying gmp functions).
    
    This patch avoids calling rsa_private_key_prepare every time we construct
    a nettle private key struct, because this function requires a bigint
    multiplication. We call that function once on private key import.

    x509: Fix DNS name constraints checking
    
    - If the intersection of name constraints of the given type was empty, the results allowed all names instead of none.
    - Fixed by adding an universal excluded name constraint in case the intersection for the particular type is empty.
    - Moved the logic of creating a name constraint node copy from _gnutls_name_constraints_intersect to name_constraints_intersect_nodes (previously name_constraints_match), as intersecting IP addresses will require further processing (not just taking one of the compared nodes as was the implementation till now).
    - GNUTLS_SAN_MAX added in order to comfortably iterate over SAN type enum.

    Added auto-detection of getrandom() system call in Linux systems
    
    In addition use getrandom() via the syscall interface if it doesn't
    exist in Libc. The reason for the latter is that getrandom() support
    for glibc is in limbo for several years, and for auto-detection is that
    even if it is going to be present in libc we will not be able to guarrantee
    that the system call is available just because it is present in glibc.
    For that we detect on initialization whether getrandom() can obtain
    random data, and if yes, we continue using that.

    tests: added checks for system priority file fallback mechanism

Author: Daniel P. Berrange <berrange@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 3 16:57:02 2016 +0100

    gnutls_priority_init: multiple @KEYWORD lookups with fallback
    
    The support for using "@KEYWORD" as a priority string is very
    useful to separate selection of priorities from application
    specific code or config files. It is, however, not general
    enough to fully serve all reasonable use cases.
    
    For example, consider an application sets
    
      gnutls_priority_set_direct(session, "@SYSTEM", NULL);
    
    The system administrator can modify the global priorities
    file to change what "@SYSTEM" resolves to for all apps using
    GNUTLS. As soon as one application wishes to have a slightly
    different configuration from others on the host, you have to
    go back and start modifying application specific configuration
    files once more. This is bad for the system administrator as
    it means there's no longer one single place where they can
    see the priority configuration for all apps.
    
    They may try to get around this problem by configuring the
    app to use a different keyword, instead of a full priority
    string, eg "@LIBVIRT". So the global priorities file can
    now define entries for both "SYSTEM" and "LIBVIRT". This
    has still placed a burden on the administrator change the
    config in two places - both libvirt config files and the
    global priorities file.
    
    What is more desirable is if applications were able to provide
    a list of keywords that would be tried in order, picking the
    first that existed. For example, libvirt could be written to
    request the following by default
    
      gnutls_priority_set_direct(session, "@LIBVIRT,SYSTEM", NULL);
    
    With this, gnutls would first try to find the "LIBVIRT" keyword
    in the global configuration file, and if that is not present,
    then it would fallback to trying to find the "SYSTEM" keyword.
    
    This provides nice "out of the box" behaviour for system
    administrators, whereby the app would be using "SYSTEM" initially
    and if the admin wishes to give the app a custom configuration,
    they can simply modify the global priorities file to add in the
    application specific keyword "LIBVIRT". There is never a need
    for the sysadmin to modify any application specific configuration
    files any more. It is exclusively controlled in one place via the
    global priorities file.

    _gnutls_resolve_priorities: always try to re-read sys priority file

    take effect on the very next TLS session an application created.

        priorities: preload the system priorities on library loading time
    
    It is required to restart every application after changing the
    system priority file to get changes to take effect.
    
    Further, for applications running in a chroot, it will no longer
    honour a system priority file that may exist inside the chroot,
    always using the originally cached data from outside the chroot.
    
    This patch changes the caching so that we always try to reload
    the cache of system priorities. A mtime check is used to avoid
    actually re-reading the file unless its content has obviously
    changed. If the file no longer exists, the cache will not be
    invalidated. This ensures that the current priority file is
    always honoured, whether inside a chroot or not, while at the
    same time allowing apps to work in a chroot when no system
    priority file is present.

    keylogfile: only consider the SSLKEYLOGFILE variable
    
    In addition do not check the environment in the constructor
    but instead use static variables to save the key file name.
    The GNUTLS_KEYLOGFILE environment variable is no longer used
    since there is no reason to have a separate one.

    _gnutls_check_key_purpose: in CA certificates treat the SGC key purpose as GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER
    
    This is a hack for certain very old CA certificates lurking around which instead
    of having the GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER have some old OIDs for that purpose. Consider
    these OIDs equivalent to GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER in marked as CA certificates.

    gnutls-cli: --save-ocsp will work even if verification fails

    issues.

    ocsp: attempt harder to figure an OCSP staple issuer
    
    That is, check initially against the trust list set on the credentials,
    and if verification is not possible attempt with all certificates in
    the chain as possible issuers. The reason of this enhancement is the
    few servers have an OCSP response signed not by their direct CA but
    rather by one of the higher level CAs.

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue May 31 13:49:13 2016 +0200

    several sign-related API changes
    
    This replaces the usage of "int" in functions which could only
    have accepted an "unsigned" value. Also functions which return
    unsigned values are explicitly tagged as such. The ABI remains
    the same with these changes.
    
    This allows easier catching of sign/unsigned related errors from
    the calling applications.

    pkcs11: the flag GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT will be respected by imported certificates
    
    That is, certificates imported with gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url() or
    gnutls_x509_crt_import_url() will be able to be extracted with their

    added flag in session to force sending a client certificate
    
    This handles the use case of a client connecting to a server
    which incorrectly lists the CA certificates it supports. Without
    that change the only option was to avoid using the "automatic"
    client certificate functions, but rather utilize callbacks.
    With that approach this use case is handled by the "automatic"
    certificate selection functions.

    Fix library build on Chrome Native Client (NaCl)
    
    Some supported toolchains define DT_UNKNOWN but do not
    define _DIRENT_HAVE_D_TYPE (and do not have the d_type field).
    On other platforms GnuTLS may need to second-guess what the
    library is reporting, but on NaCl this is unsafe.

    That is, an additional flag GNUTLS_ENABLE_FALSE_START is introduced
    for gnutls_init(), and that enables support for false start. At
    this point false start will be performed by the handshake if possible,
    and gnutls_record_recv() will handle handshake completion.

    the "correct" value when asked. Correct being the next number after

    session tickets: avoid GCM for session tickets and rely on CBC and HMAC
    
    The latter is more resilient against non-key renewal.

    Broke apart _gnutls_recv_int() to the packet and non-packet cases.
    
    Only gnutls_record_recv_packet() called _gnutls_recv_int() with
    (packet != NULL). I refactored this logic directly downstream into
    gnutls_record_recv_packet(). The _gnutls_recv_int() function now only
    handles non-packet specific logic. The check_session_status() function
    was created to deduplicate common code which would otherwise have
    ended up in both functions.
    
    The rationale behind this change is to optimize what were previously
    calls of _gnutls_recv_int(). First of all _gnutls_recv_int() now has
    only 6 parameters, which according to the x86_64 System V Application
    Binary Interface should now fit into CPU registers and no longer use
    the stack. Secondly this change avoids a number of branching checks
    for both packet and non-packet cases.

    alpn: ALPN state is per-connection, it should not be saved with session data
    
    In addition the extension was moved to the mandatory to parse to ensure it
    is always parsed when sessions are resumed.
    
    rfc7301:
        Unlike many other TLS extensions, this extension does not establish
        properties of the session, only of the connection.  When session
        resumption or session tickets [RFC5077] are used, the previous
        contents of this extension are irrelevant, and only the values in the
        new handshake messages are considered.

    Reduce the number of used syscalls by using sendmsg() instead of writev()
    
    We relied on sendmsg() anyway for the MSG_NO_SIGNAL version of the calls,
    thus it is a good idea to avoid calling writev() and use sendmsg(). That
    way we reduce the number of calls required for seccomp.

    is a much cleaner approach than 5a4e692511dc3a829eda0d7c5a87e56cbc2055f0.

    Do not allow certificate change during a rehandshake
    
    That is require that the certificate of the peer remains the same
    and return GNUTLS_E_SESSION_CERTIFICATE_CHANGED otherwise. To revert
    to the previous behavior the GNUTLS_ALLOW_CERT_CHANGE flag was introduced.

Date:   Mon Aug 24 12:00:10 2015 +0200

    Added simpler verification functions for clients
    
    The major use-case for the TLS protocol is verification of PKIX
    certificates. However, certificate verification support while is
    similar for almost all projects it requires around 100 lines of code
    (a callback) to be duplicated to all applications. That patch
    set gets rid of the callback and simplifies certificate verification
    support, by introducing a very simple API; one that would accept
    the session and the hostname only.

    Re-enable the certificate key usage checks for compliance with ciphersuite
    
    There is a new attack on the TLS protocol which relies on using certificates
    for ECDSA as certificates for ECDH ciphersuites. That attack while it doesn't
    affect gnutls, which doesn't support static ECDH, assumes that implementations
    ignore the key usage bits in the certificate. We have done it since 3.1.0 for
    compatibility reasons (see http://www.gnutls.org/faq.html#key-usage-violation),
    but that clearly opens the door for real attacks in the future.
    
    For this reason the key usage bits will no longer be ignored.

    certtool --outder should not emit signature verification status
    
    When emitting binary-formatted output, send signature verification
    status to stderr, since it is not binary-formatted output.
    
    A simpler version of this patch would be to always send signature
    verification to stderr, but that would change the text-formatted
    output.

    DSA signatures and DHE-DSS are disabled by default
    
    DSA was an algorithm that was never deployed on the Internet
    and had, until very recently, several limitations such as
    restriction of its keys to 1024 bits, SHA1-only etc. Given
    that there are literally 0 internet (HTTPS) certificates using
    DSA, there is no point to enable it by default and increase
    our attack surface.

    tests: Added test case for openpgp keys loaded by callback

Author: Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos <nmav@gnutls.org>
Date:   Sat Jan 10 12:12:25 2015 +0100

    When setting up TLS with cert-type OpenPGP from a client,
    the server verifies if it supports the extension’s contents
    in _gnutls_session_cert_type_supported().  This function
    checks for cred->get_cert_callback but not cred->get_cert_callback2.
    As a result, servers setup for OpenPGP certificate credential
    callback with gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2() are
    unable to use the OpenPGP certificate type.
    
    The solution is to consider cred->get_cert_callback2 alongside
    cred->get_cert_callback in _gnutls_session_cert_type_supported().

    Don't call _gnutls_cipher_encrypt2 with textlen = 0 in _gnutls_auth_cipher_encrypt2_tag
    
    If the plaintext is shorter than the block size of the used cipher,
    _gnutls_auth_cipher_encrypt2_tag calls _gnutls_cipher_encrypt2 with
    textlen = 0. By definition _gnutls_cipher_encrypt2 does nothing in this
    case and thus does not need to be called.

    Handle zero length plaintext for VIA PadLock functions
    
    If the plaintext is shorter than the block size of the used cipher,
    _gnutls_auth_cipher_encrypt2_tag calls _gnutls_cipher_encrypt2 with
    textlen = 0. padlock_ecb_encrypt and padlock_cbc_encrypt assume that the
    plaintext length (last parameter) is greater than zero and segfault
    otherwise. The assembler code for both functions is automatically
    generated and imported from OpenSSL, so to ease maintenance the length
    should be validated in the functions that call padlock_ecb_encrypt or
    padlock_cbc_encrypt.

    it has been marked as MUST NOT do that. That will be fixed in a later
    revision but since then there are servers not accepting SSL 3.0
    as a valid record version (note that this is about the record
    version, which describes the format of the packet, nothing to
    do with the negotiated version).

    parts in URLs (e.g., object-type=cert, when there is a certificate).
