What's new in 0.3

- Command line options to select a specific camera, like gphoto2.

What's new in 0.2
-----------------

- Fixed a big memory leak that happened whenever a directory
  was listed.
- Report libgphoto2_port errors.
- Set UID and GID to match the user who ran gphotofs.
  - This is cosmetic. The allow_root and allow_other fuse options
    are what really control access.

  - Notices libgphoto2 errors and tries to map them to errnos.

    nonexistent file.

    (I have no idea how it will act will multiple cameras plugged in.)
  - Can delete files.
